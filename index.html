                  Angular 2 is an open source JavaScript framework to build web applications in HTML and JavaScript.
                  This tutorial looks at the various aspects of Angular 2 framework which includes the basics of the
                  framework, the setup of Angular and how to work
                  with the various aspects of the framework. Other topics discussed in the tutorial are advanced
                  chapters such as interfaces, nested components and services within Angular. Topics such as routing,
                  modules, and arrays
               </p>
               <p>
                  The user should be familiar with the basics of web development and JavaScript. Since the Angular
                  framework is built on the JavaScript framework, it becomes easier for the user to understand Angular
                  if they know JavaScript.

                  Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable
                  network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight
                  and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time
                  applications that run across distributed devices.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and
                  networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the
                  Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

                  React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
                  application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
                  changes.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
                  through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

                  Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue
                  is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view
                  layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate
                  with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of
                  powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and
                  supporting libraries.

                  principles and a sample project.
